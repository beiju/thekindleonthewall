They're easy to use, and pretty\nlightweight, so they shouldn't rain on your parade:\n\n    <canvas id=\"icon1\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></canvas>\n    <canvas id=\"icon2\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></canvas>\n\n    <script>\n      var skycons = new Skycons({\"color\": \"pink\"});\n\n      // you can add a canvas by it's ID...\n      skycons.add(\"icon1\", Skycons.PARTLY_CLOUDY_DAY);\n\n      // ...or by the canvas DOM element itself.\n      skycons.add(document.getElementById(\"icon2\"), Skycons.RAIN);\n\n      // start animation!\n      skycons.play();\n\n      // you can also halt animation with skycons.pause()\n\n      // want to change the icon? no problem:\n      skycons.set(\"icon1\", Skycons.PARTLY_CLOUDY_NIGHT);\n\n      // want to remove one altogether? no problem:\n      skycons.remove(\"icon2\");\n    </script>\n\nSkycons were designed for [Forecast](http://forecast.io/) by those wacky folks\nat The Dark Sky Company, and were heavily inspired by Adam Whitcroft's\nexcellent [Climacons](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/). The source code has\nbeen released into the public domain, so please do with it as you see fit! â™¡\n",
